###This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created with three intentions
  - one: keep my videos easy to access without open many tabs.
  - two: create songs combinations, like [lo-fi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A) and [rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q76bMs-NwRk).
  - three: see other people ideias to implement and create something amazing.
